# CamelCaseWithTests

Simple program - asks user for a sentence; converts that sentence into a camelCase method name.

e.g. "extract data from file" becomes "extractDataFromFile"

Includes unit tests for a camel case method name generator.

One unit test is failing. Can you fix the program so all the tests pass?
